## Introduction

deblocus is a tunneling software that allows encrypted TCP connection through the server by acting as a SOCKS5/HTTP proxy server on the client side.

## Features

- Traffic encrypted with dynamic session key
	* deblocus has perfect [forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy).
- Tunnel's communication was provided with mildly obfuscated traffic based on special protocol
	* Keep communications encrypted and privacy over untrusted networks.
- TCP multiplexing inside tunnel and Fast-Open over application layer
	* Optimized connectivity for massive short requests, latency greatly reduced to nearly 1-RTT.
- Filtering traffic to specified country (using GeoLite2 data)
	* You can avoid the proxy was used for some inappropriate purposes.
- High-performance encryption implementation
	* You can enjoy high throughput and low resource consumption.
